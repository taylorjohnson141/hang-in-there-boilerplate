  README of our hang-in-there-boilerplate! Here with the combined words of two geniuses, one will be guided through the process of our little motivational poster.

Here is our completed program: https://taylorjohnson141.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate



## After The links

  After you arrive to the webpage, you are presented with a variety of options. You initially see a motivational poster with an image, a title, and a quote.

  Underneath those mentioned above, we have several buttons:

  * Save This Poster
  * Show Saved Posters
  * Show Another Random Poster
  * Make Your Own Poster

 Side note:

 If one was unhappy with the picture, but doesn't feel like clicking the button for a new image, they could simply refresh the page and a whole new image will follow.

 # Save This Poster

 If you decide that you like a poster, you can make a decision to save the poster. Don't worry though, these changes aren't permanent. If you find yourself unhappy with a saved selection or for whatever motives, you can double click anywhere on the picture and it will be deleted from your saved photos.



 When saving a poster, you don't have to be bothered by any annoying duplications because you hit the save button too many times.

 # Build Your Own

 If you find that none of our little pre-made examples and snippets are not to your fancy... then you can create your own!

 By clicking the Make Your Own Poster button, you will be brought to a little section with a few inputs for the user.

 After arriving at your new page, you can see three new text boxes.

 * Image URL
 * Motivational Titile
 * Motivational Quote

 After you type some options you can decide to change your mind, or up and create your new poster!

 Enjoy your custom poster, here's one of ours..
